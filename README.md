#Edin's Boilerplate

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed
3. Make sure you have gulp globally installed, `npm install -g gulp`
4. Install local dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory of this project
5. Run:
    1. `gulp watch` to launch a local server and watch files
    2. `gulp build` to build a minified version of the project
    3. `gulp clean` to clean the `build` folder

If you get any errors when running `gulp`, try installing the Stylus plugins globally by running `npm install -g jeet@6.1.2 nib rupture`.

## Todo:
1. Add a `globals.json` file defining main variables
2. Add JS linting
